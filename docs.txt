step-1 
create a virtual environment

step-2 
create a folder (data) ----> store all datasets.

step-3
create a folder (API)---> for storing our trained model in pkl format.
1. app.py
2. model.pkl

step-4
create a folder (src)--->
make this as an package using __init__.py
create a file(train.py)----> model training and shift the trained model in api/model.pkl .

step-5
create a folder (tests)---->
make this as an package.
this will test our training model using pytest for unit testing(one by one test).

step-6
create a file (requirements.txt) ---> in which we will store all libraries that is needed for running this application.

step-7
create a 'Readme.md file.
create a docs.txt file ---> for project understanding.

python src/train.py
streamlit run api/app.py
